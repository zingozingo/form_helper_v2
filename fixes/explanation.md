# Message Channel Error Fix

## Problem
The error message "A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received" occurs when:

1. A message handler returns `true` to indicate it will respond asynchronously
2. The channel closes before `sendResponse()` is called

## Root Cause
In the `scanForms` message handler in `content.js`, the code was:
1. Running `scanFormsForPanel()` synchronously 
2. Calling `sendResponse({success: true})` after the function completes
3. Returning `true` to indicate async response

However, `scanFormsForPanel()` triggers a complex chain of operations including:
- DOM manipulation (highlighting fields)
- Additional message passing to the background script
- Multiple DOM traversal operations

This was causing a race condition where:
1. The message handler claimed it would respond asynchronously (by returning `true`)
2. It immediately called `sendResponse()` 
3. But the underlying form scanning operations were continuing
4. In certain cases, the execution took too long, causing the promise in the caller to remain unresolved
5. When this happened in `basic-html-form-test.html`, the channel was closed before completing

## Solution
The fix wraps the form scanning logic in a `setTimeout(fn, 0)` to:
1. Make the operation truly asynchronous 
2. Send an immediate response before any scanning begins
3. Let the scanning continue in the background without blocking
4. Add error handling to catch and report any exceptions during scanning

This approach ensures:
1. The extension sends a response immediately
2. The message channel doesn't close prematurely
3. Form scanning continues in the background 
4. Results are communicated via separate message events

This pattern would need to be applied to any other message handlers that might have similar issues with complex operations.
